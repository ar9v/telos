                <h2>Need</h2>
                <p>
                    As college students and pomodoro users we asked ourselves this question: how do we know
                    when we've disproportionately destined pomodoros to one school course over others? Telos
                    is a possible answer to this problem. As per
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law"
                       class="txtref"
                       target="_blank">Parkinson's Law,
                    </a>
                    tasks tend to take up as much time as they have for their completion, so as an artificial
                    limit, we've decided to put pomodoros in the context of a week. We believe that this
                    perspective enables us to use our time more conscientiously.
                </p>
                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>
                    Telos is based on Francesco Cirillo's
                    <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique"
                       class="txtref"
                       target="_blank">
                        Pomodoro Technique
                    </a> and aims to be a step towards its goals beyond being a way to concentrate. Furthermore,
                    Telos is inspired by the
                    <a href="https://github.com/merveilles/Time-Travelers"
                       class="txtref"
                       target="_blank">
                        Time Travelers.
                    </a>
                    We believe that time management is a very personal endeavor, and that simplicity is
                    paramount to success. We would like to thank them for their hard work.
                </p>
                <h2>Basic workflow</h2>
                <p>
                    To use Telos, head to Home, sign-up, and login. This will take you to the Dashboard.
                    Once in the Dashboard, a basic workflow would look something like this:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Click on Configuration and add a Course by suppying a name and a number which
                            represents the amount of hours you will dedicate to that course
                            <i>at most</i> during the week.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            A Course Card will pop up. Close the configuration and click on the Card to
                            populate the Course Information Area. A task input will appear on the right.
                            You can supply tasks to populate the area further.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Click on the pomodoro timer start button when you're ready to work. Pomodoros
                            are atomic, which means that you either complete one or you don't. Concentrate
                            and work hard! You can always stop the pomodoro by clicking on the Stop button.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Pomodoro times can be changed in the Configuration menu. These values represent
                            minutes. Try to fiddle around to find your preferred balance.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Once the timer runs out, the information in the Course Card will be updated and
                            you'll be able to start your break. The History Cards on the lower portion of
                            the page will indicate how many pomodoros you've completed historically.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    And that is pretty much it! If you are new to the Pomodoro Technique, check the link in the
