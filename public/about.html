                    People, especially students, tend to procrastinate not
                    necessarily out of laziness but rather due to things such as analysis paralysis
                    . Even though analysis paralysis can be caused by a myriad of things, one very
                    identifiable and controllable cause is usually anxiety due to poor time
                    management. Furthermore, poor time management isn't necessarily due to lack of
                    eort, but sometimes even due to the contrary: overexertion in a particular task.
                    Countless time management methodologies have been created, but one of the
                    simplest is the Pomodoro Technique . The Pomodoro Technique mitigates the
                    problem of overexertion by limiting working bursts to twenty-five minutes at a
                    time. Overall, we believe it is a very useful technique. However, what happens
                    when you dedicate more bursts (pomodoros) to a specific task? We believe that
                    there is a need to further refine the technique based on how courses are set up
                    (e.g. each course is 8 units, so 5 hours out of class for work). In general, we
                    think that there is a need for a simple, Pomodoro-based, set of tools that
                    provides comprehensive means to time management without being too overwhelming
                    (i.e. something neither too professional nor too basic).
