* Telos
A week-based Pomodoro Timer and a simple Logger.

** Background
First and foremost, Telos is inspired by the [[https://github.com/merveilles/Time-Travelers][Time Travelers]]. This has several
implications, but we feel that the most important one is that it is /an attempt/
at time management; a /work in progress/.

Having said that, Telos does have an underlying heuristic: it is
Pomodoro-based. Particularly, we believe that while the Pomodoro's foremost goal
(bringing focus to work) is important, we would like an extra hand
when it comes to the higher level goals pertaining logging. One such goal is
effort estimation. Suppose that you use Pomodoro's to complete tasks. How do you
know when you've dedicated a disproportionate amount of pomodoros to a task? In
our specific case, as college students, the question is: how do we know when
we're dedicating more time to a given course /versus/ other courses?

This worry stems mainly from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law][Parkinson's Law]], which we believe can be alleviated
with our heuristic (it is not the only one!!). Namely, each course in our
college has an associated number of units which represents the amount of hours
one /should/ dedicate to a given course per week. Therefore, the amount of
units represents an artificial (but useful) limit. In the next section, we
explore the implications of this idea.

** Workflow
To use Telos, head to Home, sign-up, and login. This will take you to the Dashboard.
Once in the Dashboard, a basic workflow would look something like this:

- Click on Configuration and add a Course by supplying a name and a number which
  represents the amount of hours you will dedicate to that course /at most/
  during the week.

- A Course Card will pop up. Close the configuration and click on the Card to
  populate the Course Information Area. A task input will appear on the right.
  You can supply tasks to populate the area further.

- Click on the pomodoro timer start button when you're ready to work. Pomodoros
  are atomic, which means that you either complete one or you don't. Concentrate
  and work hard! You can always stop the pomodoro by clicking on the Stop button.

- Pomodoro times can be changed in the Configuration menu. These values represent
  minutes. Try to fiddle around to find your preferred balance.

- Once the timer runs out, the information in the Course Card will be updated and
  you'll be able to start your break. The History Cards on the lower portion of
  the page will indicate how many pomodoros you've completed historically.

And that's pretty much it! If you've got some ideas, feel free to drop a line
